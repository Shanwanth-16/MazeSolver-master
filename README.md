MazeSolver
==========

An application designed to generate random **solvable** mazes of *any* size, and solve them! The program uses an implementation of the A* algorithm to solve these mazes. Clone the repo and give it a try yourself!

Unsolved | Solved

Your only limitation to the size of the maze is the sky itself (well, and the size of your console and monitor I guess). 

Building
----------------------------------------------------
There are no dependencies for this repo, *yay!* All you need to worry about is building the project.

Windows
---------
1. Clone the master MazeSolver repository in a directory of your choice.

2. Create a build folder. This project requires and out-of-tree build. This means you ~will be unable to~ **should not** run CMake in the MazeGen folder.

3. Open up the CMake GUI. in the input box labeled "Where is the source code:", enter the full path to the source folder. In the input box labeled "Where to build the binaries" , enter the full path to the folder you created in step 2.

4. Press the "Configure" button. A window will pop up asking you which compiler to use. Selecter any version your heart desires but this tutorial will center around VS, so we're going to select to build a VS project. 

5. hit "Generate".

6. Open up the build folder, double click the Solution file and build the project. All done!

Linux
---------
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Syntaf/MazeSolver`

2. Navigate to the project: `cd MazeSolver`  

3. Build internal depedencies with CMake: `cmake .` (or path to directory containing CMakeLists.txt)  

4. Build executable: `make`

Usage
------
`./MazeSolver -p` runs the program with print functionality, or just run it with `./MazeSolver` . Super simple!
