MazeSolver
==========

An application designed to generate random solvable mazes of any size, and solve them! The program uses an implementation of the A* algorithm to solve these mazes. Clone the repo and give it a try yourself!

It uses a well known algorithm for path finding that is A* algorithm . it is a algo that uses both heuristics and previously follwed distances to guide the maze in a correct direction

Width and Height of maze have no limitation
